This is a fork of dimok's SignPatcher2SysMenu

How to use :
- In your SD card, in the wiiu/ folder, create titleToLaunch.txt
- Inside this file, put the TitleID of the title you want to launch ater the signature patches

If the file doesn't exist, it will create it.

By default, of if there's a problem with the ID, it will default to the System Menu and write to the file the encountered problem
